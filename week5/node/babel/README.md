Babel is a JavaScript compiler

Babel is a toolchain that is mainly used to convert ECMAScript 2015+ code into a backwards compatible version of JavaScript in current and older browsers or environments. Here are the main things Babel can do for you:

1.Transform syntax
2.Polyfill features that are missing in your target environment (through @babel/polyfill)
3.Source code transformations (codemods)
